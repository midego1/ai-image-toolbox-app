# Expo Camera Best Practices Guide

## Current Implementation Status ✅

Your app is using:
- **expo-camera**: `^17.0.8` ✅
- **CameraView API** (modern API) ✅
- **useCameraPermissions** hook ✅

## ✅ What You're Doing Right

### 1. **Using Optical Zoom (Not Digital Zoom)**
```typescript
// ✅ GOOD: You're avoiding digital zoom (zoom prop = 0)
zoom={0}
selectedLens={availableLensIdentifiers[selectedLens]}
```
**Why this matters:** Digital zoom crops the image and reduces quality. Optical zoom switches physical lenses for true zoom without quality loss.

### 2. **Proper Permission Handling**
```typescript
const [permission, requestPermission] = useCameraPermissions();
```
**Good practice:** Always check permissions before accessing camera.

### 3. **Error Handling**
```typescript
onMountError={(error) => {
  console.error('[QuickCamera] Camera mount error:', error);
  Alert.alert('Camera Error', error.message || 'Failed to initialize camera');
}}
```
**Important:** Camera can fail on older devices or when another app is using it.

### 4. **Screen Flash for Front Camera**
You're implementing screen flash for front-facing camera - excellent UX choice since front cameras don't have physical flash.

## ⚠️ Important Considerations for TestFlight/iOS

### 1. **Camera Permissions in Info.plist**

Verify your `Info.plist` has the correct descriptions (✅ Already present):
- `NSCameraUsageDescription` - Required for camera access
- `NSMicrophoneUsageDescription` - Required if recording video

### 2. **Camera Availability on iOS**

**Common Issues:**
- Some devices have multiple camera modules (wide, ultra-wide, telephoto)
- Front camera may not support all lenses
- iPad devices may have different camera configurations

**Your Implementation Handles This:**
```typescript
onAvailableLensesChanged={(event) => {
  // Dynamically detect available lenses
}}
```
This is excellent - you're detecting available lenses at runtime.

### 3. **iOS Camera Restrictions**

**For TestFlight/App Store:**
- ✅ Camera permissions must be requested properly
- ✅ Camera usage description must explain why you need camera access
- ⚠️ Some camera features may be restricted on certain iOS versions
- ⚠️ Background camera access is heavily restricted (not allowed in most cases)

## 🚀 Performance Optimization Tips

### 1. **Camera Lifecycle Management**

**Current Implementation:**
```typescript
const cameraRef = useRef<any>(null);
```

**Recommendation:** Clean up camera resources when component unmounts:

```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  return () => {
    // Camera is automatically cleaned up by CameraView
    // But you can add any custom cleanup here
  };
}, []);
```

### 2. **Take Picture Optimization**

Your current implementation:
```typescript
const photo = await cameraRef.current.takePictureAsync({
  quality: 0.9, // Good - balance between size and quality
  base64: false, // Good - base64 is slow and memory-intensive
  skipProcessing: false,
});
```

**Best Practices:**
- ✅ `quality: 0.9` - Good balance (1.0 = best quality, larger file)
- ✅ `base64: false` - Only enable if you need to send image over network immediately
- ✅ `skipProcessing: false` - Keep false for best image quality

### 3. **Memory Management**

**Issue:** Large photos can cause memory issues, especially on older devices.

**Your Solution:** You're using `ImageManipulator` to compress thumbnails:
```typescript
const manipulated = await ImageManipulator.manipulateAsync(
  assets.assets[0].uri,
  [],
  { compress: 0.3, format: ImageManipulator.SaveFormat.JPEG }
);
```

**Additional Recommendation:** For the full-resolution photo, consider:
- Storing to file system immediately (you're doing this ✅)
- Not keeping multiple large photos in memory
- Compressing before uploading to your API

## 📱 Device-Specific Considerations

### iPhone Models

| Model | Available Lenses | Notes |
|-------|-----------------|-------|
| iPhone 11+ | Wide, Ultra-wide | Front camera: single lens |
| iPhone 12 Pro+ | Wide, Ultra-wide, Telephoto | Pro models only |
| iPhone 14 Pro+ | Wide, Ultra-wide, Telephoto, Macro | Latest features |
| iPad | Varies | Some iPads have limited cameras |

**Your Code Handles:** ✅ You're detecting available lenses dynamically

### Common Issues by Device

1. **Older iPhones (iPhone 8 and earlier)**
   - May not support multiple lenses
   - Limited flash modes
   - Slower camera initialization

2. **iPad**
   - Camera position varies (front/back)
   - Some models have single lens only
   - Larger screen = different UI considerations

## 🔧 Common Pitfalls & Solutions

### 1. **Camera Not Initializing**

**Symptoms:** Black screen, error on mount

**Causes:**
- Another app using camera
- Device doesn't support requested camera type
- Permission denied

**Your Error Handling:** ✅ You have `onMountError` handler

**Additional Tip:** Add retry logic:
```typescript
const [retryCount, setRetryCount] = useState(0);

const handleMountError = (error) => {
  if (retryCount < 3) {
    setTimeout(() => {
      setRetryCount(retryCount + 1);
      // Force remount
    }, 1000);
  } else {
    Alert.alert('Camera Error', 'Unable to access camera. Please close other apps using the camera.');
  }
};
```

### 2. **Flash Not Working**

**For Back Camera:** ✅ You're using proper flash prop
```typescript
flash={(facing === 'front' ? 'off' : (flashMode === 'on' ? 'on' : ...))}
```

**For Front Camera:** ✅ You're using screen flash implementation

### 3. **Lens Switching Not Working**

**Your Implementation:** ✅ Using `selectedLens` prop correctly

**Watch Out For:**
- Some devices don't support lens switching (single lens only)
- Front camera may only have one lens
- Lens IDs may vary by device model

**Your Detection:** ✅ `onAvailableLensesChanged` callback handles this

### 4. **Photo Capture Delays**

**Common Causes:**
- Processing large images
- Saving to file system
- Network upload

**Optimization:**
```typescript
// Capture immediately
const photo = await cameraRef.current.takePictureAsync({
  quality: 0.9,
  skipProcessing: false, // Keep false for quality
});

// Show preview immediately (you're doing this ✅)
setCapturedImageUri(photo.uri);

// Process/save in background
savePhotoAsync(photo.uri); // Run this asynchronously
```

## 🔐 Security & Privacy

### 1. **Photo Storage**

**Your Implementation:** ✅ Saving to MediaLibrary

**Best Practices:**
- ✅ Request MediaLibrary permissions separately
- ✅ Handle permission denial gracefully
- ✅ Consider secure storage for sensitive photos (though you may not need this)

### 2. **Privacy Considerations**

**For TestFlight/App Store Review:**
- ✅ You have camera usage description
- ✅ You have photo library usage description
- ⚠️ Make sure descriptions explain why you need access
- ⚠️ Don't access camera in background (you're not doing this ✅)

  - [ ] Screen flash works (front camera)
  - [ ] Lens switching works (if available)
  - [ ] Photo capture works
  - [ ] Photo saves to library
  
- [ ] Test permission flows:

  - [ ] Permission denied (handle gracefully)
  - [ ] Permission granted
  
- [ ] Test edge cases:
  - [ ] Switching cameras during capture
  - [ ] Taking multiple photos rapidly
  - [ ] Low memory conditions
  - [ ] Other app using camera

## 🎯 Version-Specific Notes

### expo-camera v17.x

**Features You're Using:**
- ✅ `CameraView` (recommended over deprecated `Camera`)
- ✅ `useCameraPermissions` hook
- ✅ `selectedLens` prop for optical zoom
- ✅ `onAvailableLensesChanged` callback

**Known Issues:**
- Some devices may not report all available lenses immediately
- Front camera lens detection can be inconsistent

**Your Workaround:** ✅ Using both `getAvailableLenses()` method and `onAvailableLensesChanged` callback

## 💡 Advanced Tips

### 1. **Camera Preview Quality**

You can optimize preview resolution (though this may not be necessary):
```typescript
// Lower preview resolution = better performance
// But user experience may suffer
// Current implementation uses default (recommended)
```

### 2. **Focus Indicator**

Your implementation:
```typescript
const handleFocus = async (event: any) => {
  // Focus handling
};
```

**Enhancement:** Consider showing visual focus indicator:
```typescript
// Add animated focus rectangle on tap
```

### 3. **Exposure Control** (Future Enhancement)

Currently not exposed in expo-camera v17, but may be available in future versions.

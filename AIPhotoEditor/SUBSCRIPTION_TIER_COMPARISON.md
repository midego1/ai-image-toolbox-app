## Real-World Examples

### Option 5 Usage:
- More consumer-focused apps
- Gaming apps with personality
- Entertainment apps wanting visual flair

---

## Recommendation: **Option 2 (iOS Segmented Control)**

### Why Option 2 Wins:

1. **Perfect iOS Integration**
   - Your app already uses iOS design patterns (MainHeader, system colors)
   - Segmented control feels native and trustworthy
   - Users expect this pattern in iOS apps

2. **Clarity Over Ambiguity**
   - Text is unambiguous: "Basic", "Pro", "Premium"
   - Icons (📱/💼/⭐) require interpretation
   - For subscriptions, clarity is critical

3. **Accessibility First**
   - Screen readers read "Basic", "Pro", "Premium" clearly
   - Icons require additional labels for accessibility
   - Better for users with visual impairments

4. **Professional Credibility**
   - Subscription screens need to feel trustworthy
   - Segmented control = mature, stable UI
   - Icons can feel playful, less serious

5. **Implementation Simplicity**
   - Uses React Native's built-in styling
   - No icon sourcing/creation needed
   - Easier to maintain

### When to Choose Option 5 Instead:

Consider Option 5 if:
- Your app has a very playful, consumer-focused brand
- You're targeting younger demographics
- Visual differentiation is more important than clarity
- You have custom icon assets that are clear and consistent

---

## Final Verdict

**Go with Option 2** - It's the professional, accessible, iOS-native choice that prioritizes clarity and user trust in a subscription context.

**Hybrid Approach** (If you want best of both):
- Use Option 2 (segmented control) as the primary selection
- Show icons in the feature list below to add visual interest
- Best of both worlds: clarity where it matters, personality in the details

### Model Selection Strategy

The app uses a **primary model approach** with model-specific processors:

1. **Nano Banana** - Primary workhorse for most transformations
   - Single unified model for multiple features
   - Consistent API interface
   - Reliable and fast

2. **Specialized Models** - Used when specific capabilities are needed
   - Rembg for precise background removal
   - Future models for specific tasks (face swap, restoration, etc.)

3. **Version Management**
   - Nano Banana uses a fixed version for consistency
   - Rembg uses latest version for improved accuracy
   - All models accessed via Replicate API versioning system

### API Integration

All models are accessed through:
- **Platform**: Replicate API (`api.replicate.com`)
- **Authentication**: Secure API key storage (Expo Secure Store)
- **Request Format**: REST API with JSON payloads
- **Response Format**: Asynchronous prediction polling
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive retry logic and timeout management

### Pricing Overview

#### Replicate Pricing Model
Replicate charges based on **GPU compute time** (per second of usage). Pricing varies by:
- Model complexity and GPU requirements
- Image/video resolution and size
- Processing duration
- Current Replicate pricing tiers

**Typical Replicate Costs:**
- Image processing: $0.002-0.006 per second of GPU time
- Video generation: $0.01-0.025 per second of GPU time
- High-end models: Premium pricing for advanced capabilities

#### Kie.ai Pricing Model
Kie.ai offers a unified credit-based system for accessing multiple AI models through a single API. Pricing is managed through their marketplace system.

**Kie.ai Advantages:**
- Unified API for multiple models
- Credit-based pricing model
- Potentially better rates for bulk usage
- Single integration point for video models

**Note**: Kie.ai pricing details should be checked on their marketplace for current rates as they may offer competitive pricing compared to direct model access.

#### Cost Optimization Strategy

1. **Credit-Based Billing**: App uses credit system to abstract API costs from users
2. **Model Selection**: Prioritize cost-effective models (e.g., Rembg for background removal)
3. **Caching**: Implement result caching where possible to reduce duplicate API calls
4. **User Limits**: Subscription tiers balance user value with API costs
5. **Provider Flexibility**: Support both Replicate and Kie.ai for best pricing options

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/vision-camera.git
   cd vision-camera/AIPhotoEditor
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

3. **Configure API Keys**

   The app requires a Replicate API key for AI features. Configure it in one of two ways:

   **Option A: Development (app.json)**
   ```json
   {
     "expo": {
       "extra": {
         "replicateApiKey": "your-replicate-api-key-here"
       }
     }
   }
   ```

   **Option B: Production (EAS Secrets)**
   ```bash
   eas secret:create --scope project --name REPLICATE_API_KEY --value your-key
   ```

   > ⚠️ **Security Note**: Never commit real API keys to git. The `.gitignore` is configured to exclude sensitive files.

4. **Start the development server**
   ```bash
   npm start
   # or
   expo start
   ```

5. **Run on a device/simulator**
   - **iOS**: Press `i` in the terminal or `npm run ios`
